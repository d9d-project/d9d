# Title

## Abstract
A short summary (~200 words) of the technical issue and the proposed solution.

## Motivation
Why is this change necessary for d9d?

## Design Proposal
The core specification. Describe the architecture in detail.

* Include pseudocode and Mermaid diagrams if necessary.
* Describe changes to the public API.
* Describe introduced entities, abstractions, configuration classes and so on.

## Usage
How the end-user will utilize this feature?

```python
import d9d.your.cool.feature

# Example user code
```

## Backward Compatibility
Will this break existing code using d9d? Will old training scripts fail?

If yes, how will we mitigate this (migration plan, deprecation warnings)?

## Alternatives Considered
Why is this design better than other options you thought of?
